# :oncoming_police_car: Vehicle_Accidents_US_2020 

#### This project has vehicle accidents int he United States during the year 2020. The data is provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA](www.nhtsa.gov). 
#### Take a look at the entire dataset [here](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/2020/National/)
#### Using some of the tables provided, I merged the some important and what I think is useful information to find some cool insight on accidents in the U.S. Every accident has infomation on the State and county the accident took place, the time and date. Also I included the total number of people involved in any accident, the number of vehicles, and fatalities that occured. 
#### To get more information on these accidents, I collected the driver's age, gender, driver-license-status, car information, speed limit of the street they were traveling on and if they were driving above the limit. I also collected information on drug and alcohol use, which give me some pretty cool insinghts!
